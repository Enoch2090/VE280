## Opportunity's dream

> The rover sees no difference between
> 
> Mars and Earth. The same vast plain
> 
> with some pits at the center and ridges lie far. 
> 
> Her internal clock always claim
> 
> that a sol is no different than a day
> 
> except forty more minutes of slack.
> 
> Therefore most of time she rests
> 
> on the edge of a crater. And soaked
> 
> in the dim sunlight just like 
> 
> back in Mojave, at dusk. If weather permits a stretch she'll
> 
> notify those remote engineers and 
> 
> never use up her cell. Until
> 
> the day when she looked upon
> 
> the glowing dome where she came from,
> 
> it stroke her that Mars is different than
> 
> Earth. It has two moons. One in clear sight
> 
> but the other concealed itself behind
> 
> the approaching sandstorm.
> 
> Soon she felt drowsy underneath
> 
> a sudden dune who promises
> 
> gloomy sleepiness, then tranquil dormancy.
> 
> Opportunity needs a distant dream
> 
> after all this place is not Earthly
> 
> and her cell is now empty.
